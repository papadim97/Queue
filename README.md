A queue or equivalently a service system is a mathematical model for modeling a real unit (client) entry-exit system in which randomness enters. The object of this theory is the quantitative study of service systems and is part of the broader cognitive field of Business Research and in particular its contemplative part.

Typical examples of queues presented in applications are the cash registers of banks and various organizations in general, call centers, call networks, the Internet and local area networks (LANs), the production lines of an industrial unit, transport networks etc.

The program I have created solves problems with queues with mathematical formulas.
